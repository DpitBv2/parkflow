## Hardware


The hardware component of the Parkflow system is divided into two main parts: sensors and hubs.

The sensors are devices installed on each parking space, which monitor in real-time whether the space is occupied or available. These sensors are connected to hubs through the LoRa (Low-Power Wide-Area Network) communication protocol.

The hubs serve as central points of connection and communication within the Parkflow system. They collect information from multiple sensors and facilitate communication between them and the central server. The hubs are strategically placed in various locations and have multiple functionalities.

Here are some key features of Parkflow hubs:

-   Sensor connectivity: Hubs allow for the connection and management of a large number of sensors in a given area. This means they can simultaneously monitor multiple parking spaces, providing updated information about their availability.
-   Communication with the central server: Hubs facilitate bidirectional communication between sensors and the central server of the Parkflow system. This enables the transfer of real-time data, such as updates on parking space availability and payment information.
-   Cash payment option: Hubs offer users the option to pay for parking with cash. This allows them to choose traditional payment methods, eliminating the need for a payment card or electronic device.
